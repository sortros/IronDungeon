# Irondungeon
The purpose of the game is to try to reach the end of the dungeon that is filled with traps.
The game screen is a canvas.
The player is represented by an image of a person(kinda like super Mario or paper Mario).
The movement of the player is to jump, to move left and to move right, for this the spacebar, left arrow and right arrow keys of the keyboard are used that make the player move in the corresponding direction.
The game ends when the player passes all stages of the dungeon.
